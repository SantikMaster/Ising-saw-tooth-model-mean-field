# Ising-saw-tooth-model-mean-fild
I wrote some program that calculate the Ising model on the saw-tooth ladder in the frame work of the mean field

The program provide you *.txt file, in which you will get h, M, M2, S1, S2, S3
h - external field
M - magnetization
S1, S2, S2 - the maen value of the each of the spins in the triangle cell.


Enjoy!
